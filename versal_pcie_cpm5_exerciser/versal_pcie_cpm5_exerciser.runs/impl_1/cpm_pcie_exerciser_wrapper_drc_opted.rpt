It is suggested to confirm via unisim simulation with SIM_COLLISION_CHECK != NONE that an address collision never occurs and if so try and avoid this situation. If address collisions cannot be avoided, the write-mode may be set to READ_FIRST which guarantees that the read data is the prior contents of the memory at the cost of additional power in the design.

DPOP-5#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP pcie_app_versal_i/EXERCISER_AXIST_1024/EXERCISER_AXIST_EP_1024/EP_MEM/EP_MEM/expect_cpld_data_size_reg0 output pcie_app_versal_i/EXERCISER_AXIST_1024/EXERCISER_AXIST_EP_1024/EP_MEM/EP_MEM/expect_cpld_data_size_reg0/P[57:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.

MREG Output pipelining  
DSP pcie_app_versal_i/EXERCISER_AXIST_1024/EXERCISER_AXIST_EP_1024/EP_MEM/EP_MEM/expect_cpld_data_size_reg0 multiplier stage pcie_app_versal_i/EXERCISER_AXIST_1024/EXERCISER_AXIST_EP_1024/EP_MEM/EP_MEM/expect_cpld_data_size_reg0/P[57:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
